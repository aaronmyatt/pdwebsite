# Examples Page

Writing HTML with pipes is totally possible, see [[home]] and [[partials]]. It just starts to feel a little masochistic! I really love the template literals though! Can I import a html file and still inject some template literals from the pipe? There's gotta be a simple library for that!

Though I don't want the header and footer to get out of sync, and reserve the right to pull in [[partials]] when I need them... ðŸ¤¯

Let's try writing only the "body" html in the `./html` dir and processing each template to wrap it with

```json
{
  "bodyPath": "./pages/html/examples.html",
  "path": "./pages/html/processed/examples.html"
}
```


## processPage
```ts
import layout from 'layout';
console.log(Deno.cwd())
const body = await Deno.readTextFile(opts.config.bodyPath)
const wrapped = await layout.process({body})
await Deno.writeTextFile(opts.config.path)
```

## servePage
```ts
import { serveFile } from "jsr:@std/http";
input.response = serveFile(input.request, './html/processed/examples.html')
```
