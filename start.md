# Start

Start the app!

```ts
import { serveFile, serveDir } from 'jsr:@std/http';
import { join } from 'jsr:@std/path';
```

## Serve API
```ts
import api from 'api'
Object.assign(input, await api.process(input));
```

## Serve Static
Seems Deno Deploy is pretty slow when it comes to file system reads. Could this be a draw back of edge hosting? Not a particularly challenging thing to overcome, however, just need to generate more HTML in the deployment script.

Or you know, use a static site generator! https://github.com/lumeland/lume
- route: /*
- not: /route/inputs/0
- ```ts
    input.response = serveDir(input.request, {
        fsRoot: join(Deno.cwd(), '_site'),
        showIndex: true,
    });
    ```
