# How to install Pipedown
Two commands are all you need. First thing we need is [Deno](https://deno.com/) - the best Javascript runtime.

## Install Deno
Follow the instructions on [Deno's website](https://deno.com/) to get Deno installed.

- On MacOS/Linux:
  - `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh`
- On Windows:
  - `irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex`

## Install Pipedown
Deno provides a useful feature to install scripts globally on your system with a customisable alias:

`deno install -Arfg -n pd jsr:@pd/pdcli`

This will install Pipedown globally. Pipedown can be run using the `pd` command. You can customise the command name by providing a different `-n` option: `deno install -Arfg -n {your_name} jsr:@pd/pdcli`

Running `pd --help` on your system should display the following:

```text
$ pd --help                                   
Pipedown
Usage: pd [command] [options]

Commands:

  run     Run a script generated by pd
  test    Run tests for all scripts generated by pd
