# How to install Pipedown
Two commands are all you need. Pipedown is a (Deno) Javascript library, so we need to install Deno, and then we can install Pipedown. Deno provides a handy feature to install scripts globally on your system with a customisable alias. This is how we will install Pipedown.

## Install Deno
First, follow the instructions from [Deno's website](https://deno.com/) to get Deno installed on your system.

- On MacOS/Linux:
  - `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh`
- On Windows:
  - `irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex`

## Install Pipedown
Once Deno is available on your system we can use Deno to install Pipedown.

`deno install -Arfg -n pd jsr:@pd/pdcli`

This will install Pipedown globally on your system. Pipedown will be available anywhere by just running the `pd` command. You can customise the command name by using a different `-n` option value: `deno install -Arfg -n {your_name} jsr:@pd/pdcli`

Running `pd --help` on your system should display the following:

```text
$ pd --help                                   
Pipedown
