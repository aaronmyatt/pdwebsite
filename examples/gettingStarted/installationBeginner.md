# How to install Pipedown

Two commands is all you need. 


## Install Deno

Follow the instructions from [Deno's website](https://deno.com/).

On MacOS/Linux:
```bash skip
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

Or

On Windows:
```bash skip
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Install Pipedown
Once Deno is available on your system we can use Deno to install Pipedown.

```bash
deno install -Arfg -n pd jsr:@pd/pdcli
```

This will install Pipedown globally on your system. Pipedown will be available anywhere by just running the `pd` command. You can customise the command name by using a different `-n` option value when using `deno install`.

Running `pd --help` on your system should display the following:

```text
$ pd --help
