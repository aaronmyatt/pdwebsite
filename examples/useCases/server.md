# Pipedown as a Server

Every Pipedown script processed and written to the `./.pd` directory of your project also has a corresponding server file.

For example, given the [[helloWorld]] pipe. You will also find the following file:

`./.pd/helloWorld/server.ts`

We piggyback on [`Deno.serve`](https://deno.land/api@v1.41.0?s=Deno.serve) to do the heavy lifting. `Deno.serve` can be used in a traditional sense, deployed on your own infrastructure, behind a reverse proxy of some kind. However, it is also compatible with Deno Deploy! Which makes it trivial to serve up your pipes, and any associated static files, with a single command. Checkout Deno Deploy:

> https://deno.com/deploy

Note: this website is hosted on Deno Deploy! Just a single command, `deployctl deploy` serves up a fresh version of this site. See the [Repo](https://github.com/aaronmyatt/pdwebsite)

## Just a wrapper
The `server.ts` is a very simple wrapper to pass requests to your pipeline.

```ts skip
const server = Deno.serve(async (request: Request) => {
  const output = await pipe.process({
        request, 
        body: {}, 
        responseOptions: {
        headers: {
            "content-type": "application/json"
        },
        status: 200,
    }
  });
  
  return new Response(output.body, output.responseOptions);
});
```

## Requests
When working with Deno, you get the pleasure of working with Web Standard [Request](https://deno.land/api@v1.44.1?s=Request) and [Response](https://deno.land/api@v1.44.1?s=Response) objects - on the server!

We pass this request to your pipeline. You can access it in any pipe codeblock with `input.request`.

## Routing
When Pipedown finds a `request` in an `input` object, it will check to see if your function is behind a `route:` condition.

For instance, a function like this:


````md
- route: /hello
    ```ts
    console.log("Hello there!");
    ```
````

Will only be executed when the request path/slug is `/hello`. Pipedown leverages [URLPatterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) to provide simple and effective routing - it even supports route params!

If a pattern is matched, Pipedown will inject add `input.route` to the function which gives you access to the URLPattern return object, e.g:

````md
- route: /hello/:name
    ```ts
    const match = $p.get(input, '/route/pathname/groups/name')
    console.log(`Hello, ${match}!`);
    ```
````

## Response
The server wrapper provides a simple response setup. If you return `input.body` from your pipe, we assume it is JSON friendly and respond to the client appropriately:

```ts skip
{
    headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json"
    },
    status: 200,
}
```

You have complete control over this object, just add your response options to `input.responseOptions` and pass any data to `input.body` if desired. Alternatively you can pass a full `new Response()` object to `input.response`.

## Concrete Example
To round things off, let's turn this Markdown file itself into a server!

Let's create a small set of routes that will return random placeholder images from some fun placeholder image providers.

### placeBear
- route: /bear
    ```ts
    // check the input.route object!
    console.log(input.route);

    const response = await fetch("https://placebear.com/640/360");
    input.response = new Response(response.body, {
        headers: {
            "content-type": "image/jpeg"
        },
        status: 200,
    });
    ```

### loremflickr
- route: /flick
    ```ts
        // check the input.route object!
        console.log(input.route);

        const response = await fetch("https://loremflickr.com/640/360");
        input.response = new Response(response.body, {
            headers: {
                "content-type": "image/jpeg"
            },
            status: 200,
        });
    ```

### Lorem Picsum
- route: /picsum
    ```ts
        // check the input.route object!
        console.log(input.route);

        const response = await fetch("https://picsum.photos/640/360");
        input.response = new Response(response.body, {
            headers: {
                "content-type": "image/jpeg"
            },
            status: 200,
        });
    ```

### Root
If no route is matched, we will return a simple text response. We use the `not:` condition here to ensure this is only executed when no route is matched.

- not: /route
- ```ts
    input.response = new Response("Hello there!", {
        headers: {
            "content-type": "text/plain"
        },
        status: 200,
    });
    ```

### RIP
A very sad discovery is that both `placekitten` and `placecage` are no longer available. RIP. ðŸ«¡

## Running the server
To run the server, execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronmyatt/pdwebsite
cd pdwebsite
# assuming you have Pipedown installed ðŸ˜‰

pd build
deno run --allow-net ./.pd/examples/server/server.ts
```

You can now access your server at `http://localhost:8000` and see random pictures at these routes:

- http://localhost:8000/bear
- http://localhost:8000/flick
- http://localhost:8000/picsum

## Toot toot
Horn tooting time! Writing and hosting servers has never been easier. Writing them with Pipedown has made it easy and delightful AND educational ðŸ‘†! Try it for yourself and reach out if you have ideas about how to make this cooler.
