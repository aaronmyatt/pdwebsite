## Not just for devs
Pipedown has been built with developers in mind, we think it is a superior way to author your logic. One of the reasons is that Pipedown is a format that non-developers can interact with, consume and contribute to!

## Breaking (magical) barriers
For too long code has been perceived in a magical light by our peers. We can bridge that divide by bringing more context and more education to our code with Pipedown - for the betterment of ourselves and all.
