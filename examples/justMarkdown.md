On the **surface** Pipedown is _just Markdown!_

## Write, Read, Host

You can do all your usual Markdown formatting, enjoy the familiarity and host it where you normally would.

## Works great with your PKM
As a bonus, your Pipedown files can live right inside your favourite Markdown based Personal Knowledge Management systems! e.g. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md/).
